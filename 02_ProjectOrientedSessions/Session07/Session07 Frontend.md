Great ‚Äî now we‚Äôre connecting both ends of your application. Let‚Äôs walk through **how authentication and authorization flow works on the frontend side (React)** when using **JWT-based authentication with a backend API**.

---

## üîÅ Overall Frontend Authentication Flow (React + JWT)

1. **User logs in**:
    
    - They submit credentials (username/password) via a login form.
        
    - Frontend sends a POST request to `/api/auth/login`.
        
    - Backend validates and responds with a **JWT** (and optionally a **refresh token**).
        
2. **Frontend stores the token**:
    
    - This is usually saved in:
        
        - `localStorage` ‚úÖ simple, persistent
            
        - or an **HttpOnly cookie** ‚úÖ safer, but needs server support
            
3. **Frontend sends the token on future API calls**:
    
    - Automatically attaches the token as a header:
        
        ```js
        Authorization: Bearer <token>
        ```
        
4. **Frontend restricts access to protected pages**:
    
    - You read the token from storage.
        
    - Decode it to extract role/claims.
        
    - Use React Router + `PrivateRoute` (or similar) to guard access.

## üß± How to Restrict Pages in React (Role-Based Routing)

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Decode and Check the Token

```bash
npm install jwt-decode
```

```js
import jwtDecode from "jwt-decode";

function getUserFromToken() {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
  if (!token) return null;

  try {
    const decoded = jwtDecode(token);
    return decoded; // contains roles, exp, username, etc.
  } catch {
    return null;
  }
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Create a Protected Route Component

```jsx
import { Navigate } from "react-router-dom";

function PrivateRoute({ children, requiredRole }) {
  const user = getUserFromToken();

  if (!user) return <Navigate to="/login" />;
  if (requiredRole && !user.role?.includes(requiredRole)) {
    return <Navigate to="/unauthorized" />;
  }

  return children;
}
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Use It in Routing

```jsx
<Route
  path="/admin-dashboard"
  element={
    <PrivateRoute requiredRole="Admin">
      <AdminDashboard />
    </PrivateRoute>
  }
/>
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Where to Store the JWT?

|Method|Persistent?|Secure?|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|`localStorage`|‚úÖ Yes|‚ùå No (accessible to JS)|Good for simple apps|
|`sessionStorage`|‚ùå No (clears on tab close)|‚ùå No||
|`HttpOnly cookie`|‚úÖ Yes|‚úÖ Yes|Needs backend to set cookie|

> üîê **If your app is vulnerable to XSS, use `HttpOnly` cookies instead of localStorage**.

---

## üß∑ Automatically Adding JWT to Requests

You can use **Axios interceptors**:

```js
// axios.js
import axios from "axios";

const api = axios.create({
  baseURL: "http://your-api-url.com/api",
});

api.interceptors.request.use(config => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  return config;
});

export default api;
```

Then use `api.get(...)` or `api.post(...)` in your services.

## üß† Summary

|Task|Solution|
|---|---|
|Protect route to logged-in users|Use custom `<PrivateRoute />` with token check|
|Check if user has a role|Decode token and inspect `role` claim|
|Send token with API requests|Use Axios interceptors|
|Save token|LocalStorage (easy) or HttpOnly cookie (secure)|
|Keep user logged in|Token stays in localStorage or cookie|
|Handle logout|Clear the token from storage|

- How to use **refresh tokens**
    

Happy to walk you through any of it!

That flow is **excellent** and matches exactly how modern applications with **JWT-based authentication** typically work. You're thinking about both UX (popup forms) and proper backend coordination ‚Äî that's a solid start.

---

## ‚úÖ Your Flow ‚Äî Reviewed & Annotated:

### **1. Account Sign-Up (Register)**

> **Frontend (React)**: Sign-up modal with:

- Phone number
    
- Password (+ confirm password)
    
- Basic validations (empty fields, password length, etc.)
    

> **Backend (ASP.NET Core API)**:

- Validate: Check if phone already exists
    
- Validate password strength (you can set rules)
    
- Hash the password securely (use `PasswordHasher<T>` or Identity's helper)
    
- Store the user in DB (with phone number as username or unique field)
    
- Return success/failure
    

‚úÖ **Note**: Use `[ApiController]`, `[FromBody]`, and model validation on the backend for clean error reporting.

---

### **2. Login Page (Popup)**

> **Frontend (React)**:

- Login modal with:
    
    - Phone number
        
    - Password
        

> **Backend**:

- Validate credentials
    
- If valid, generate:
    
    - **JWT** (access token) ‚Äî includes user ID and roles
        
    - (Optional) Refresh token
        
- Return the JWT token to the frontend
    

‚úÖ **Token Payload Example**:

```json
{
  "sub": "user_id_here",
  "phone": "09xxxxxxxxx",
  "role": "Customer",
  "exp": 1234567890
}
```

‚úÖ You‚Äôll send this token to the frontend in the response.

---

### **3. Store the Token + Access Protected Page**

> **Frontend**:

- Store the token (in `localStorage` for now)
    
- Use Axios to attach it on every request
    
- Use a `PrivateRoute` component to guard protected pages
    
- Access `/profile` page (protected by `[Authorize]` in backend)
    

> **Backend**:

- Secure `/profile` with `[Authorize(Roles = "Customer")]` or similar
    
- Parse token from `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
    
- Allow or reject based on claims
    

---

## üõ†Ô∏è What You'll Need

### Frontend:

- `react-router-dom`
    
- `axios`
    
- `jwt-decode`
    
- Modals (e.g., using Tailwind or a component lib)
    

### Backend:

- ASP.NET Core API (you already have it)
    
- JWT configuration in `Program.cs`
    
- Custom authentication controller (`/api/auth/register`, `/api/auth/login`)
    
- Role support
    
- Token generation utility

## üöÄ Ready to Begin?

Let's start with **Step 1**: Sign-up flow

Would you like to begin with:

1. **Backend first** ‚Äî setting up `/api/auth/register` endpoint and phone+password validation
    
2. **Frontend first** ‚Äî creating the sign-up modal form in React
    

Let me know your preference and we‚Äôll go step by step.
