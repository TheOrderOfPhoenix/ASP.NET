### üìç Part 0: Roadmap of This Session

#### ‚úÖ Getting Started with MVC Projects

- [x] **Directory Structure**:  
       Learn about the standard folders: `Controllers`, `Views`, `Models`, and `wwwroot`. Understand the role of `Program.cs` in bootstrapping and routing.

- [x] **Routing and Controllers**:

  - Custom routing using templates like `{controller}/{action}/{id?}`
  - Attribute routing using `[Route]`, `[HttpGet]`, etc.
  - Static segments in routes:  
    Example: `[Route("products/all")]` creates `/products/all`.

- [x] **Actions in Controllers**:

  - Return types like `ViewResult`, `JsonResult`, `ContentResult`
  - Handle multiple HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.)

- üî≤ **How to Set Default Page in ASP.NET Core**  
  _(To do: Discuss how to change the default route in `Program.cs`, e.g. set controller = Products, action = List)_

---

### üìç Part 1: Understanding Models in ASP.NET Core MVC

Models are a fundamental part of the MVC architecture, representing the **data structure and logic** of your application. They interact with the database and contain properties that hold data and methods that implement business logic.

#### üß† Model Structure and Purpose

- **Data Representation**: Models reflect real-world data structures, often aligning with database tables.
- **Data Handling**: Models encapsulate validation, relationships, and business logic.
- **Data Transport**: Used to transfer data between controllers and views.

In ASP.NET Core MVC, models are typically stored in a `Models` folder, with one class per entity (`Product`, `Customer`, `Order`, etc.).

---

### üìç Part 2: Properties in Models & C# OOP Concepts

#### ‚úÖ Properties in C#

Properties in C# provide a controlled way to access and modify private fields using `get` and `set`.

````csharp
public class Product {
    public int Id { get; set; } // Auto-property
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}

- **Auto-Implemented Properties**:
    Simplify property declarations when no extra logic is needed.


#### ‚úÖ Encapsulation and Access Modifiers

Encapsulation hides the internal workings of a class from the outside world.

- **Access Modifiers**:

    - `public`: Accessible from anywhere

    - `private`: Only inside the class

    - `protected`: Inside the class and derived classes

    - `internal`: Only within the current assembly


**MVC models typically use public properties** so they can be accessed in views and controllers.

---

### üìç Part 3: Passing a Model to a View

#### ‚úÖ Step 1: Define the Model

```csharp
public class Product {
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
}
````

#### ‚úÖ Step 2: Create a Controller Action

```csharp
public class ProductsController : Controller {
    public IActionResult Details() {
        var product = new Product {
            Id = 1,
            Name = "Laptop",
            Price = 1500.00m
        };
        return View(product); // Passing model to view
    }
}
```

#### ‚úÖ Step 3: Strongly-Typed View (`Details.cshtml`)

```cshtml
@model Product

<h2>Product Details</h2>
<p>Product Name: @Model.Name</p>
<p>Price: @Model.Price</p>
```

- `@model` tells Razor this view receives a `Product`
- `@Model` gives access to passed data

---

### üìç Passing a List of Models to the View

#### ‚úÖ Controller Action:

```csharp
public IActionResult List() {
    var products = new List<Product> {
        new Product { Id = 1, Name = "Laptop", Price = 1500.00m },
        new Product { Id = 2, Name = "Smartphone", Price = 800.00m }
    };
    return View(products);
}
```

#### ‚úÖ View (`List.cshtml`):

```cshtml
@model IEnumerable<Product>

<h2>Product List</h2>
<ul>
@foreach (var product in Model) {
    <li>@product.Name - @product.Price</li>
}
</ul>
```

- Use `IEnumerable<Product>` to pass lists
- Razor supports `foreach` directly on the `Model`

---

## üß™ Practice

- Explore and explain the MVC folder structure
- Create a model class `Product`
- Build a controller that returns a single model to a view
- Create a strongly-typed Razor view using `@model`
- Return a list of `Product` models and display them in a loop
- Show how to set the default controller and action in `Program.cs`
