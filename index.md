# **üê¶‚Äçüî•Order of the Phoenix ‚Äî Website Development**

## **About the Project**

This repository contains documents, resources, and projects created during the **first phase of the Order of the Phoenix initiative** ‚Äî a self-organized learning movement started by a group of computer science students.

What began as an effort to escape a passive academic environment evolved into a **collaborative learning experiment** ‚Äî building a solid foundation in modern web development and culminating in the development of a **Transportation Management System** inspired by platforms like **Booking.com** and **Alibaba.ir**.

The goal wasn‚Äôt just to learn a technology; it was to foster **self-driven learning, teamwork, and real-world problem-solving**.

## **Section 1 ‚Äî Introductory Sessions**

The first part of the program focused on equipping everyone with fundamental web development skills.

### **Roadmap of What We Learned**
1. **Web Fundamentals** ‚Äî HTTP, REST, and the client-server model
2. **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** ‚Äî basics of application structuring
3. **Web API Development** ‚Äî designing and consuming APIs
4. **ASP.NET Core Basics** ‚Äî setting up and building modern backends

These sessions ensured that all participants, regardless of prior experience, could contribute to a real-world project.

## **Section 2 ‚Äî Project-Based Sessions**

Once the fundamentals were solid, we moved to building a **real project**.
### **Planning Phase**
- Selected the project collaboratively (**Transportation Management System**)
- Designed a detailed **ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram)**
- Wrote **full documentation** to standardize the development process

### **Implementation Phase**

Each member implemented their **own version** of the project, applying Clean Architecture principles and experimenting with different approaches.

### **Project Overview**

#### **Backend ‚Äî Transportation Management API**
- **Tech Stack**: ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture for modularity, testability, and maintainability
- **Features**: Manage travelers, routes, tickets, and vehicle operations

#### **Frontend ‚Äî Transportation Management Web App**
- **Tech Stack**: React, TypeScript, Zustand, Axios, Tailwind CSS
- **Focus**: Clean, scalable architecture and user-friendly experience
